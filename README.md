# Le-Vin-Coup-Project
BUS110A Class Project

This is a class project which involved working on a hypothetical winery start-up, Le Vin Coupé.  

Developers:  Carlos Quirarte, Sara Pereira

Project submitted for grading at the end of November, 2017.  Our project was one of the five best projects selected to present to the class. 

Background:  Most wines are a blend of several different base wines.  A big part of the winemaker’s talent and skill is to be able to choose the right wines and to create a balanced wine in the final blend, cuvée.  Le Vin Coupé is a winery blending consultancy start-up that analyzes wine attribute data to determine wine quality and identify blending strategies that maximize wine pricing potential.  Through the use of technology, the winery believes that there is an opportunity to do a much better job of blending wines that they can use and build into an application that they could use to market to other winters as well.  The app must leverage data from the company’s propriety dataset to determine which wine attributes most greatly influence overall quality. The application must also test frequency with which specific attribute values (provided by the end user) are found in wines of different qualities.

The basic application must:
1. Require users to login to protect Le Vin’s proprietary data.
2. After logging in, allow registered employee users to register other employees.
3. Provide users with the ability to test the following associations for red wines and for white wines (separately) using the provided “Wine Quality Dataset.” Results will tell the user which of these wine characteristics most influence wine quality.
		a. volatile acidity and wine quality 
		b. fixed acidity and wine quality 
		c. alcohol percent and wine quality 
		d. residual sugar and wine quality 
4. Allow users to enter values for these four wine characteristics and provide frequency distributions of wine quality for those values.

Collaboration tools:  Google Drive was used to upload updated versions of our python file since we did not use version control tools such as Git or GitHub.  The link to view the folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B8C7qu6xYQHrVFdtVnZMRjhDek0

Reason to post on GitHub:  To display my progress in building up my coding skills.  My plan is to continue to work on this project to add more functionality and to add a GUI.
